**Goal: Analyze Instacart customer purchase behavior using modified Kaggle datasets.**

Data: Processed 5 tables (orders, products, aisles, departments, order_products) with 1M+ rows.

Preprocessing: Fixed data types, handled missing values, and removed duplicates.

Key Metrics: Examined order timing (hour/day), reorder rates, and popular products.

Visualizations: Created plots for order frequency by hour/day and customer wait times.

Insights: Identified peak shopping hours (e.g., 10 AMâ€“3 PM) and busiest days (weekends).

Top Products: Ranked top 20 frequently ordered and reordered items (e.g., bananas, milk).

Behavior Patterns: Analyzed cart size distribution and first-added items.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) for cleaning, stats, and visualizations.

Outcome: Delivered actionable insights to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

**Achievement: Transformed raw data into business-ready recommendations. ðŸ›’ðŸ“Š**
